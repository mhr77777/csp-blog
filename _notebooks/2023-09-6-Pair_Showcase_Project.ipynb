      "Destiny is an online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game series developed by Bungie and previously published by Activision. The series is now self-published by Bungie after separating from Activision in 2019.[1] Destiny marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the Halo series. Set in a \"mythic science fiction\" world, the series features a multiplayer \"shared-world\" environment with elements of role-playing games. Activities are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \"strikes\" and dungeons and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.\n",
